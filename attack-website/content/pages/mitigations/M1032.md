requiring users to provide at least two forms of verification to prove their identity before granting access. These factors typically include:\n\n- *Something you know*: Passwords, PINs.\n- *Something you have*: Physical tokens, smartphone authenticator apps.\n- *Something you are*: Biometric data such as fingerprints, facial recognition, or retinal scans.\n\nImplementing MFA across all critical systems and services ensures robust protection against account takeover and unauthorized access. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:\n\nIdentity and Access Management (IAM):\n\n- Use IAM solutions like Azure Active Directory, Okta, or AWS IAM to enforce MFA policies for all user logins, especially for privileged roles.\n- Enable conditional access policies to enforce MFA for risky sign-ins (e.g., unfamiliar devices, geolocations).\n\nAuthentication Tools and Methods:\n\n- Use authenticator applications such as Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, or Authy for time-based one-time passwords (TOTP).\n- Deploy hardware-based tokens like YubiKey, RSA SecurID, or smart cards for additional security.\n- Enforce biometric authentication for compatible devices and applications.\n\nSecure Legacy Systems:\n\n- Integrate MFA solutions with older systems using third-party tools like Duo Security or Thales SafeNet.\n- Enable RADIUS/NPS servers to facilitate MFA for VPNs, RDP, and other network logins.\n\nMonitoring and Alerting:\n\n- Use SIEM tools to monitor failed MFA attempts, login anomalies, or brute-force attempts against MFA systems.\n- Implement alerts for suspicious MFA activities, such as repeated failed codes or new device registrations.\n\nTraining and Policy Enforcement:\n\n- Educate employees on the importance of MFA and secure authenticator usage.\n- Enforce policies that require MFA on all critical systems, especially for remote access, privileged accounts, and cloud applications.", "version": "1.1", "techniques_addressed_data": [{"domain": "enterprise", "id": "T1098", "name": "Account Manipulation", "technique_used": true, "subtechniques": [{"technique_used": true, "domain": "enterprise", "id": "001", "name": "Additional Cloud Credentials", "descr": "Use multi-factor authentication for user and privileged accounts.
