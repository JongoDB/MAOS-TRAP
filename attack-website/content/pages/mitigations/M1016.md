assessment of systems, applications, and networks to identify misconfigurations, unpatched software, or other security weaknesses. The process helps prioritize remediation efforts by classifying vulnerabilities based on risk and impact, reducing the likelihood of exploitation by adversaries. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: \n\nProactive Identification of Vulnerabilities\n\n- Implementation: Use tools like Nessus or OpenVAS to scan endpoints, servers, and applications for missing patches and configuration issues. Schedule regular scans to ensure timely identification of vulnerabilities introduced by new deployments or updates.\n- Use Case: A scan identifies unpatched software, such as outdated Apache servers, which could be exploited via CVE-XXXX-XXXX. The server is promptly patched, mitigating the risk.\n\nCloud Environment Scanning\n\n- Implementation: Use cloud-specific vulnerability management tools like AWS Inspector, Azure Security Center, or GCP Security Command Center to identify issues like open S3 buckets or overly permissive IAM roles.\n- Use Case: The scan detects a misconfigured S3 bucket with public read access, which is remediated to prevent potential data leakage.\n\nNetwork Device Scanning\n\n- Implementation: Use tools to scan network devices for vulnerabilities, such as weak SNMP strings or outdated firmware. Correlate scan results with vendor advisories to prioritize updates.\n- Use Case: Scanning detects a router running outdated firmware vulnerable to CVE-XXXX-YYYY. The firmware is updated to a secure version.\n\nWeb Application Scanning\n\n- Implementation: Use dynamic application security testing (DAST) tools such as OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite to scan for common vulnerabilities like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS). Perform regular scans post-deployment to identify newly introduced vulnerabilities.\n- Use Case: A scan identifies a cross-site scripting vulnerability in a form input field, which is promptly remediated by developers.\n\nPrioritizing Vulnerabilities\n\n- Implementation: Use vulnerability scoring frameworks like CVSS to assess severity.\nIntegrate vulnerability scanning tools with ticketing systems to assign remediation tasks based on criticality.\n- Use Case: A critical vulnerability with a CVSS score of 9.8 affecting remote access servers is prioritized and patched first.\n\n*Tools for Implementation*\n\nOpen Source Tools:\n\n- OpenVAS: Comprehensive network and system vulnerability scanning.\n- OWASP ZAP: Dynamic scanning of web applications for vulnerabilities.\n- Nmap with NSE Scripts: Network scanning with scripts to detect vulnerabilities.", "version": "1.2", "techniques_addressed_data": [{"technique_used": true, "domain": "enterprise", "id": "T1190", "name": "Exploit Public-Facing Application", "descr": "Regularly scan externally facing systems for vulnerabilities and establish procedures to rapidly patch systems when critical vulnerabilities are discovered through scanning and through public disclosure.(Citation: OWASP Top 10)", "subtechniques": [], "color": 1}, {"technique_used": true, "domain": "enterprise", "id": "T1210", "name": "Exploitation of Remote Services", "descr": "Regularly scan the internal network for available services to identify new and potentially vulnerable services.", "subtechniques": [], "color": 1}, {"domain": "enterprise", "id": "T1195", "name": "Supply Chain Compromise", "technique_used": true, "subtechniques": [{"technique_used": true, "domain": "enterprise", "id": "001", "name": "Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools", "descr": "Continuous monitoring of vulnerability sources and the use of automatic and manual code review tools should also be implemented as well.(Citation: OWASP Top 10)", "subtechniques": [], "color": 1}, {"technique_used": true, "domain": "enterprise", "id": "002", "name": "Compromise Software Supply Chain", "descr": "Continuous monitoring of vulnerability sources and the use of automatic and manual code review tools should also be implemented as well.(Citation: OWASP Top 10)", "subtechniques": [], "color": 1}], "descr": "Continuous monitoring of vulnerability sources and the use of automatic and manual code review tools should also be implemented as well.(Citation: OWASP Top 10)"}], "layers": [{"domain": "enterprise", "name": "Enterprise", "filename": "M1016-enterprise-layer.json", "navigator_link": "https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator/"}], "citations": {"current_number": 0, "OWASP Top 10": {"description": "OWASP.
