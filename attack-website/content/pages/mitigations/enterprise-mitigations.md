govern how and when accounts can be used. These policies include enforcing account lockout mechanisms, restricting login times, and setting inactivity timeouts. Proper configuration of these policies reduces the risk of brute-force attacks, credential theft, and unauthorized access by limiting the opportunities for malicious actors to exploit accounts. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:\n\nAccount Lockout Policies:\n\n- Implementation: Configure account lockout settings so that after a defined number of failed login attempts (e.g., 3-5 attempts), the account is locked for a specific time period (e.g., 15 minutes) or requires an administrator to unlock it.\n- Use Case: This prevents brute-force attacks by limiting how many incorrect password attempts can be made before the account is temporarily disabled, reducing the likelihood of an attacker successfully guessing a password.\n\nLogin Time Restrictions:\n\n- Implementation: Set up login time policies to restrict when users or groups can log into systems. For example, only allowing login during standard business hours (e.g., 8 AM to 6 PM) for non-administrative accounts.\n- Use Case: This prevents unauthorized access outside of approved working hours, where login attempts might be more suspicious or harder to monitor. For example, if an account that is only supposed to be active during the day logs in at 2 AM, it should raise an alert or be blocked.\n\nInactivity Timeout and Session Termination:\n\n- Implementation: Enforce session timeouts after a period of inactivity (e.g., 10-15 minutes) and require users to re-authenticate if they wish to resume the session.\n- Use Case: This policy prevents attackers from hijacking active sessions left unattended. For example, if an employee walks away from their computer without locking it, an attacker with physical access to the system would be unable to exploit the session.\n\nPassword Aging Policies:\n\n- Implementation: Enforce password aging rules, requiring users to change their passwords after a defined period (e.g., 90 days) and ensure passwords are not reused by maintaining a password history.\n- Use Case: This limits the risk of compromised passwords being used indefinitely. Regular password changes make it more difficult for attackers to reuse stolen credentials.\n\nAccount Expiration and Deactivation:\n\n- Implementation: Configure user accounts, especially for temporary or contract workers, to automatically expire after a set date or event. Accounts that remain unused for a specific period should be deactivated automatically.\n- Use Case: This prevents dormant accounts from becoming an attack vector. For example, an attacker can exploit unused accounts if they are not properly monitored or deactivated.\n\n**Tools for Implementation**:\n\n- Group Policy Objects (GPOs) in Windows: To enforce account lockout thresholds, login time restrictions, session timeouts, and password policies.\n- Identity and Access Management (IAM) solutions: For centralized management of user accounts, session policies, and automated deactivation of accounts.\n- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platforms: To monitor and alert on unusual login activity, such as failed logins or out-of-hours access attempts.\n- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Tools: To further enforce secure login attempts, preventing brute-force or credential stuffing attacks.\n"}, {"id": "M1015", "name": "Active Directory Configuration", "descr": "Implement robust Active Directory (AD) configurations using group policies to secure user accounts, control access, and minimize the attack surface. AD configurations enable centralized control over account settings, logon policies, and permissions, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and lateral movement within the network. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:\n\nAccount Configuration:\n\n- Implementation: Use domain accounts instead of local accounts to leverage AD\u2019s centralized management, including group policies, auditing, and access control.\n- Use Case: For IT staff managing shared resources, provision domain accounts that allow IT teams to log in centrally, reducing the risk of unmanaged, rogue local accounts on individual machines.\n\nInteractive Logon Restrictions:\n\n- Implementation: Configure group policies to restrict interactive logons (e.g., direct physical or RDP logons) for service accounts or privileged accounts that do not require such access.\n- Use Case: Prevent service accounts, such as SQL Server accounts, from having interactive logon privileges. This reduces the risk of these accounts being leveraged for lateral movement if compromised.\n\nRemote Desktop Settings:\n\n- Implementation: Limit Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access to specific, authorized accounts. Use group policies to enforce this, allowing only necessary users to establish RDP sessions.\n- Use Case: On sensitive servers (e.g., domain controllers or financial databases), restrict RDP access to administrative accounts only, while all other users are denied access.\n\nDedicated Administrative Accounts:\n\n- Implementation: Create domain-wide administrative accounts that are restricted from interactive logons, designed solely for high-level tasks (e.g., software installation, patching).\n- Use Case: Create separate administrative accounts for different purposes, such as one set of accounts for installations and another for managing repository access. This limits exposure and helps reduce attack vectors.\n\nAuthentication Silos:\n\n- Implementation: Configure Authentication Silos in AD, using group policies to create access zones with restrictions based on membership, such as the Protected Users security group. This restricts access to critical accounts and minimizes exposure to potential threats.\n- Use Case: Place high-risk or high-value accounts, such as executive or administrative accounts, in an Authentication Silo with extra controls, limiting their exposure to only necessary systems. This reduces the risk of credential misuse or abuse if these accounts are compromised.\n\n**Tools for Implementation**:\n\n- Active Directory Group Policies: Use Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) to configure, deploy, and enforce policies across AD environments.\n- PowerShell: Automate account configuration, logon restrictions, and policy application using PowerShell scripts.\n- AD Administrative Center: Manage Authentication Silos and configure high-level policies for critical user groups within AD."}, {"id": "M1049", "name": "Antivirus/Antimalware", "descr": "Antivirus/Antimalware solutions utilize signatures, heuristics, and behavioral analysis to detect, block, and remediate malicious software, including viruses, trojans, ransomware, and spyware. These solutions continuously monitor endpoints and systems for known malicious patterns and suspicious behaviors that indicate compromise. Antivirus/Antimalware software should be deployed across all devices, with automated updates to ensure protection against the latest threats. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:\n\nSignature-Based Detection:\n\n- Implementation: Use predefined signatures to identify known malware based on unique patterns such as file hashes, byte sequences, or command-line arguments. This method is effective against known threats.\n- Use Case: When malware like \"Emotet\" is detected, its signature (such as a specific file hash) matches a known database of malicious software, triggering an alert and allowing immediate quarantine of the infected file.\n\nHeuristic-Based Detection:\n\n- Implementation: Deploy heuristic algorithms that analyze behavior and characteristics of files and processes to identify potential malware, even if it doesn\u2019t match a known signature.\n- Use Case: If a program attempts to modify multiple critical system files or initiate suspicious network communications, heuristic analysis may flag it as potentially malicious, even if no specific malware signature is available.\n\nBehavioral Detection (Behavior Prevention):\n\n- Implementation: Use behavioral analysis to detect patterns of abnormal activities, such as unusual system calls, unauthorized file encryption, or attempts to escalate privileges.\n- Use Case: Behavioral analysis can detect ransomware attacks early by identifying behavior like mass file encryption, even before a specific ransomware signature has been identified.\n\nReal-Time Scanning:\n\n- Implementation: Enable real-time scanning to automatically inspect files and network traffic for signs of malware as they are accessed, downloaded, or executed.\n- Use Case: When a user downloads an email attachment, the antivirus solution scans the file in real-time, checking it against both signatures and heuristics to detect any malicious content before it can be opened.\n\nCloud-Assisted Threat Intelligence:\n\n- Implementation: Use cloud-based threat intelligence to ensure the antivirus solution can access the latest malware definitions and real-time threat feeds from a global database of emerging threats.\n- Use Case: Cloud-assisted antivirus solutions quickly identify newly discovered malware by cross-referencing against global threat databases, providing real-time protection against zero-day attacks.\n\n**Tools for Implementation**:\n\n- Endpoint Security Platforms: Use solutions such as EDR for comprehensive antivirus/antimalware protection across all systems.\n- Centralized Management: Implement centralized antivirus management consoles that provide visibility into threat activity, enable policy enforcement, and automate updates.\n- Behavioral Analysis Tools: Leverage solutions with advanced behavioral analysis capabilities to detect malicious activity patterns that don\u2019t rely on known signatures."}, {"id": "M1013", "name": "Application Developer Guidance", "descr": "Application Developer Guidance focuses on providing developers with the knowledge, tools, and best practices needed to write secure code, reduce vulnerabilities, and implement secure design principles. By integrating security throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC), this mitigation aims to prevent the introduction of exploitable weaknesses in applications, systems, and APIs. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:\n \nPreventing SQL Injection (Secure Coding Practice):\n\n- Implementation: Train developers to use parameterized queries or prepared statements instead of directly embedding user input into SQL queries.\n- Use Case: A web application accepts user input to search a database. By sanitizing and validating user inputs, developers can prevent attackers from injecting malicious SQL commands.\n\nCross-Site Scripting (XSS) Mitigation:\n\n- Implementation: Require developers to implement output encoding for all user-generated content displayed on a web page.\n- Use Case: An e-commerce site allows users to leave product reviews. Properly encoding and escaping user inputs prevents malicious scripts from being executed in other users\u2019 browsers.\n\nSecure API Design:\n\n- Implementation: Train developers to authenticate all API endpoints and avoid exposing sensitive information in API responses.\n- Use Case: A mobile banking application uses APIs for account management. By enforcing token-based authentication for every API call, developers reduce the risk of unauthorized access.\n\nStatic Code Analysis in the Build Pipeline:\n\n- Implementation: Incorporate tools into CI/CD pipelines to automatically scan for vulnerabilities during the build process.\n- Use Case: A fintech company integrates static analysis tools to detect hardcoded credentials in their source code before deployment.\n\nThreat Modeling in the Design Phase:\n\n- Implementation: Use frameworks like STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) to assess threats during application design.\n- Use Case: Before launching a customer portal, a SaaS company identifies potential abuse cases, such as session hijacking, and designs mitigations like secure session management.\n\n**Tools for Implementation**:\n\n- Static Code Analysis Tools: Use tools that can scan for known vulnerabilities in source code.\n- Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST): Use tools like Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP to simulate runtime attacks and identify vulnerabilities.\n- Secure Frameworks: Recommend secure-by-default frameworks (e.g., Django for Python, Spring Security for Java) that enforce security best practices."}, {"id": "M1048", "name": "Application Isolation and Sandboxing", "descr": "Application Isolation and Sandboxing refers to the technique of restricting the execution of code to a controlled and isolated environment (e.g., a virtual environment, container, or sandbox). This method prevents potentially malicious code from affecting the rest of the system or network by limiting access to sensitive resources and critical operations. The goal is to contain threats and minimize their impact. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:\n\nBrowser Sandboxing:\n\n- Use Case: Implement browser sandboxing to isolate untrusted web content, preventing malicious web pages or scripts from accessing sensitive system files.\n- Implementation: Use tools like Google Chrome's built-in sandbox or deploy solutions like Bromium to secure user web interactions.\n\nApplication Virtualization:\n\n- Use Case: Deploy critical or high-risk applications in a virtualized environment to ensure any compromise does not affect the host system.\n- Implementation: Use application virtualization platforms to run applications in isolated environments.\n\nEmail Attachment Sandboxing:\n\n- Use Case: Route email attachments to a sandbox environment to detect and block malware before delivering emails to end-users.\n- Implementation: Integrate security solutions with sandbox capabilities to analyze email attachments.\n\nEndpoint Sandboxing:\n\n- Use Case: Run all downloaded files and applications in a restricted environment to monitor their behavior for malicious activity.\n- Implementation: Use endpoint protection tools for sandboxing at the endpoint level."}, {"id": "M1047", "name": "Audit", "descr": "Auditing is the process of recording activity and systematically reviewing and analyzing the activity and system configurations. The primary purpose of auditing is to detect anomalies and identify potential threats or weaknesses in the environment. Proper auditing configurations can also help to meet compliance requirements. The process of auditing encompasses regular analysis of user behaviors and system logs in support of proactive security measures.\n\nAuditing is applicable to all systems used within an organization, from the front door of a building to accessing a file on a fileserver. It is considered more critical for regulated industries such as, healthcare, finance and government where compliance requirements demand stringent tracking of user and system activates.This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: \n\nSystem Audit:\n\n- Use Case: Regularly assess system configurations to ensure compliance with organizational security policies.\n- Implementation: Use tools to scan for deviations from established benchmarks.\n\nPermission Audits:\n\n- Use Case: Review file and folder permissions to minimize the risk of unauthorized access or privilege escalation.\n- Implementation: Run access reviews to identify users or groups with excessive permissions.\n\nSoftware Audits:\n\n- Use Case: Identify outdated, unsupported, or insecure software that could serve as an attack vector.\n- Implementation: Use inventory and vulnerability scanning tools to detect outdated versions and recommend secure alternatives.\n\nConfiguration Audits:\n\n- Use Case: Evaluate system and network configurations to ensure secure settings (e.g., disabled SMBv1, enabled MFA).\n- Implementation: Implement automated configuration scanning tools like SCAP (Security Content Automation Protocol) to identify non-compliant systems.\n\nNetwork Audits:\n\n- Use Case: Examine network traffic, firewall rules, and endpoint communications to identify unauthorized or insecure connections.\n- Implementation: Utilize tools such as Wireshark, or Zeek to monitor and log suspicious network behavior."}, {"id": "M1040", "name": "Behavior Prevention on Endpoint", "descr": "Behavior Prevention on Endpoint refers to the use of technologies and strategies to detect and block potentially malicious activities by analyzing the behavior of processes, files, API calls, and other endpoint events. Rather than relying solely on known signatures, this approach leverages heuristics, machine learning, and real-time monitoring to identify anomalous patterns indicative of an attack. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:\n\nSuspicious Process Behavior:\n\n- Implementation: Use Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools to monitor and block processes exhibiting unusual behavior, such as privilege escalation attempts.\n- Use Case: An attacker uses a known vulnerability to spawn a privileged process from a user-level application. The endpoint tool detects the abnormal parent-child process relationship and blocks the action.\n\nUnauthorized File Access:\n\n- Implementation: Leverage Data Loss Prevention (DLP) or endpoint tools to block processes attempting to access sensitive files without proper authorization.\n- Use Case: A process tries to read or modify a sensitive file located in a restricted directory, such as /etc/shadow on Linux or the SAM registry hive on Windows. The endpoint tool identifies this anomalous behavior and prevents it.\n\nAbnormal API Calls:\n\n- Implementation: Implement runtime analysis tools to monitor API calls and block those associated with malicious activities.\n- Use Case: A process dynamically injects itself into another process to hijack its execution. The endpoint detects the abnormal use of APIs like `OpenProcess` and `WriteProcessMemory` and terminates the offending process.\n\nExploit Prevention:\n\n- Implementation: Use behavioral exploit prevention tools to detect and block exploits attempting to gain unauthorized access.\n- Use Case: A buffer overflow exploit is launched against a vulnerable application.
