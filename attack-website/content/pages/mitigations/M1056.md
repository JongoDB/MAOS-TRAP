implemented to prevent adversaries from successfully identifying and exploiting weaknesses during the Reconnaissance and Resource Development phases of an attack. These activities focus on reducing an organization's attack surface, identify adversarial preparation efforts, and increase the difficulty for attackers to conduct successful operations. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:\n\nLimit Information Exposure:\n\n- Regularly audit and sanitize publicly available data, including job posts, websites, and social media.\n- Use tools like OSINT monitoring platforms (e.g., SpiderFoot, Recon-ng) to identify leaked information.\n\nProtect Domain and DNS Infrastructure:\n\n- Enable DNSSEC and use WHOIS privacy protection.\n- Monitor for domain hijacking or lookalike domains using services like RiskIQ or DomainTools.\n\nExternal Monitoring:\n\n- Use tools like Shodan, Censys to monitor your external attack surface.\n- Deploy external vulnerability scanners to proactively address weaknesses.\n\nThreat Intelligence:\n\n- Leverage platforms like MISP, Recorded Future, or Anomali to track adversarial infrastructure, tools, and activity.\n\nContent and Email Protections:\n\n- Use email security solutions like Proofpoint, Microsoft Defender for Office 365, or Mimecast.\n- Enforce SPF/DKIM/DMARC policies to protect against email spoofing.\n\nTraining and Awareness:\n\n- Educate employees on identifying phishing attempts, securing their social media, and avoiding information leaks.", "version": "1.1", "techniques_addressed_data": [{"technique_used": true, "domain": "enterprise", "id": "T1650", "name": "Acquire Access", "descr": "This technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls.
