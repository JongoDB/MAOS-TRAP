adjustments to the settings of applications, middleware, databases, or other software to mitigate potential threats.

This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:\n\nConduct a Security Review of Application Settings:\n\n- Review the software documentation to identify recommended security configurations.\n- Compare default settings against organizational policies and compliance requirements.\n\nImplement Access Controls and Permissions:\n\n- Restrict access to sensitive features or data within the software.\n- Enforce least privilege principles for all roles and accounts interacting with the software.\n\nEnable Logging and Monitoring:\n\n- Configure detailed logging for key application events such as authentication failures, configuration changes, or unusual activity.\n- Integrate logs with a centralized monitoring solution, such as a SIEM.\n\nUpdate and Patch Software Regularly:\n\n- Ensure the software is kept up-to-date with the latest security patches to address known vulnerabilities.\n- Use automated patch management tools to streamline the update process.\n\nDisable Unnecessary Features or Services:\n\n- Turn off unused functionality or components that could introduce vulnerabilities, such as debugging interfaces or deprecated APIs.\n\nTest Configuration Changes:\n\n- Perform configuration changes in a staging environment before applying them in production.\n- Conduct regular audits to ensure that settings remain aligned with security policies.\n\n*Tools for Implementation*\n\nConfiguration Management Tools:\n\n- Ansible: Automates configuration changes across multiple applications and environments.\n- Chef: Ensures consistent application settings through code-based configuration management.\n- Puppet: Automates software configurations and audits changes for compliance.\n\nSecurity Benchmarking Tools:\n\n- CIS-CAT: Provides benchmarks and audits for secure software configurations.\n- Aqua Security Trivy: Scans containerized applications for configuration issues.\n\nVulnerability Management Solutions:\n\n- Nessus: Identifies misconfigurations and suggests corrective actions.\n\nLogging and Monitoring Tools:\n\n- Splunk: Aggregates and analyzes application logs to detect suspicious activity.", "version": "1.3", "techniques_addressed_data": [{"domain": "enterprise", "id": "T1543", "name": "Create or Modify System Process", "technique_used": true, "subtechniques": [{"technique_used": true, "domain": "enterprise", "id": "005", "name": "Container Service", "descr": "Where possible, consider enforcing the use of container services in rootless mode to limit the possibility of privilege escalation or malicious effects on the host running the container.
