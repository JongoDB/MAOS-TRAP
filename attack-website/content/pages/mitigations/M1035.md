file shares, remote systems, and services, to only those users, accounts, or systems with a legitimate business requirement. This can include employing technologies like network concentrators, RDP gateways, and zero-trust network access (ZTNA) models, alongside hardening services and protocols. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:\n\nAudit and Restrict Access:\n\n- Regularly audit permissions for file shares, network services, and remote access tools.\n- Remove unnecessary access and enforce least privilege principles for users and services.\n- Use Active Directory and IAM tools to restrict access based on roles and attributes.\n\nDeploy Secure Remote Access Solutions:\n\n- Use RDP gateways, VPN concentrators, and ZTNA solutions to aggregate and secure remote access connections.\n- Configure access controls to restrict connections based on time, device, and user identity.\n- Enforce MFA for all remote access mechanisms.\n\nDisable Unnecessary Services:\n\n- Identify running services using tools like netstat (Windows/Linux) or Nmap.\n- Disable unused services, such as Telnet, FTP, and legacy SMB, to reduce the attack surface.\n- Use firewall rules to block traffic on unused ports and protocols.\n\nNetwork Segmentation and Isolation:\n\n- Use VLANs, firewalls, or micro-segmentation to isolate critical network resources from general access.\n- Restrict communication between subnets to prevent lateral movement.\n\nMonitor and Log Access:\n\n- Monitor access attempts to file shares, RDP, and remote network resources using SIEM tools.\n- Enable auditing and logging for successful and failed attempts to access restricted resources.\n\n*Tools for Implementation*\n\nFile Share Management:\n\n- Microsoft Active Directory Group Policies\n- Samba (Linux/Unix file share management)\n- AccessEnum (Windows access auditing tool)\n\nSecure Remote Access:\n\n- Microsoft Remote Desktop Gateway\n- Apache Guacamole (open-source RDP/VNC gateway)\n- Zero Trust solutions: Tailscale, Cloudflare Zero Trust\n\nService and Protocol Hardening:\n\n- Nmap or Nessus for network service discovery\n- Windows Group Policy Editor for disabling SMBv1, Telnet, and legacy protocols\n- iptables or firewalld (Linux) for blocking unnecessary traffic\n\nNetwork Segmentation:\n\n- pfSense for open-source network isolation", "version": "1.1", "techniques_addressed_data": [{"technique_used": true, "domain": "enterprise", "id": "T1557", "name": "Adversary-in-the-Middle", "descr": "Limit access to network infrastructure and resources that can be used to reshape traffic or otherwise produce AiTM conditions.", "subtechniques": [{"technique_used": true, "domain": "enterprise", "id": "002", "name": "ARP Cache Poisoning", "descr": "Create static ARP entries for networked devices.
