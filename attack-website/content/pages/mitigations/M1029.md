security logs and sensitive files, to secure, off-host locations to minimize unauthorized access, tampering, or destruction by adversaries. By leveraging remote storage solutions, organizations enhance the protection of forensic evidence, sensitive information, and monitoring data. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:\n\nCentralized Log Management:\n\n- Configure endpoints to forward security logs to a centralized log collector or SIEM.\n- Use tools like Splunk Graylog, or Security Onion to aggregate and store logs.\n- Example command (Linux): `sudo auditd | tee /var/log/audit/audit.log | nc <remote-log-server> 514`\n\nRemote File Storage Solutions:\n\n- Utilize cloud storage solutions like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage for sensitive data.\n- Ensure proper encryption at rest and access control policies (IAM roles, ACLs).\n\nIntrusion Detection Log Forwarding:\n\n- Forward logs from IDS/IPS systems (e.g., Zeek/Suricata) to a remote security information system.\n- Example for Suricata log forwarding:\n`outputs:\n  - type: syslog\n    protocol: tls\n    address: <remote-syslog-server>`\n\nImmutable Backup Configurations:\n\n- Enable immutable storage settings for backups to prevent adversaries from modifying or deleting data.\n- Example: AWS S3 Object Lock.\n\nData Encryption:\n\n- Ensure encryption for sensitive data using AES-256 at rest and TLS 1.2+ for data in transit.\nTools: OpenSSL, BitLocker, LUKS for Linux.", "version": "1.1", "techniques_addressed_data": [{"technique_used": true, "domain": "enterprise", "id": "T1119", "name": "Automated Collection", "descr": "Encryption and off-system storage of sensitive information may be one way to mitigate collection of files, but may not stop an adversary from acquiring the information if an intrusion persists over a long period of time and the adversary is able to discover and access the data through other means.", "subtechniques": [], "color": 1}, {"technique_used": true, "domain": "enterprise", "id": "T1565", "name": "Data Manipulation", "descr": "Consider implementing IT disaster recovery plans that contain procedures for taking regular data backups that can be used to restore organizational data.(Citation: Ready.gov IT DRP) Ensure backups are stored off system and is protected from common methods adversaries may use to gain access and manipulate backups.", "subtechniques": [{"technique_used": true, "domain": "enterprise", "id": "001", "name": "Stored Data Manipulation", "descr": "Consider implementing IT disaster recovery plans that contain procedures for taking regular data backups that can be used to restore organizational data.(Citation: Ready.gov IT DRP) Ensure backups are stored off system and is protected from common methods adversaries may use to gain access and manipulate backups.", "subtechniques": [], "color": 1}], "color": 1}, {"domain": "enterprise", "id": "T1070", "name": "Indicator Removal", "technique_used": true, "subtechniques": [{"technique_used": true, "domain": "enterprise", "id": "001", "name": "Clear Windows Event Logs", "descr": "Automatically forward events to a log server or data repository to prevent conditions in which the adversary can locate and manipulate data on the local system.
