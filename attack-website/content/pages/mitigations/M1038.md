systems by implementing application control, script blocking, and other execution prevention mechanisms. This ensures that only trusted and authorized code is executed, reducing the risk of malware and unauthorized actions. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:\n\nApplication Control:\n\n- Use Case: Use tools like AppLocker or Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) to create whitelists of authorized applications and block unauthorized ones. On Linux, use tools like SELinux or AppArmor to define mandatory access control policies for application execution.\n- Implementation: Allow only digitally signed or pre-approved applications to execute on servers and endpoints. (e.g., `New-AppLockerPolicy -PolicyType Enforced -FilePath \"C:\\Policies\\AppLocker.xml\"`) \n\n\nScript Blocking:\n\n- Use Case: Use script control mechanisms to block unauthorized execution of scripts, such as PowerShell or JavaScript. Web Browsers: Use browser extensions or settings to block JavaScript execution from untrusted sources.\n- Implementation: Configure PowerShell to enforce Constrained Language Mode for non-administrator users. (e.g., `Set-ExecutionPolicy AllSigned`) \n\nExecutable Blocking:\n\n- Use Case: Prevent execution of binaries from suspicious locations, such as `%TEMP%` or `%APPDATA%` directories.\n- Implementation: Block execution of `.exe`, `.bat`, or `.ps1` files from user-writable directories.\n\nDynamic Analysis Prevention:\n- Use Case: Use behavior-based execution prevention tools to identify and block malicious activity in real time.\n- Implemenation: Employ EDR solutions that analyze runtime behavior and block suspicious code execution.", "version": "1.3", "techniques_addressed_data": [{"technique_used": true, "domain": "enterprise", "id": "T1548", "name": "Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism", "descr": "System settings can prevent applications from running that haven't been downloaded from legitimate repositories which may help mitigate some of these issues.
