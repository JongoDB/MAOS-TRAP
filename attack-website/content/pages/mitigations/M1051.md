vulnerabilities by applying patches and upgrades provided by vendors. Regular updates reduce the attack surface and prevent adversaries from exploiting known security gaps. This includes patching operating systems, applications, drivers, and firmware. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:\n\nRegular Operating System Updates\n\n- Implementation: Apply the latest Windows security updates monthly using WSUS (Windows Server Update Services) or a similar patch management solution. Configure systems to check for updates automatically and schedule reboots during maintenance windows.\n- Use Case: Prevents exploitation of OS vulnerabilities such as privilege escalation or remote code execution.\n\nApplication Patching\n\n- Implementation: Monitor Apache's update release notes for security patches addressing vulnerabilities. Schedule updates for off-peak hours to avoid downtime while maintaining security compliance.\n- Use Case: Prevents exploitation of web application vulnerabilities, such as those leading to unauthorized access or data breaches.\n\nFirmware Updates\n\n- Implementation: Regularly check the vendor\u2019s website for firmware updates addressing vulnerabilities. Plan for update deployment during scheduled maintenance to minimize business disruption.\n- Use Case: Protects against vulnerabilities that adversaries could exploit to gain access to network devices or inject malicious traffic.\n\nEmergency Patch Deployment\n\n- Implementation: Use the emergency patch deployment feature of the organization's patch management tool to apply updates to all affected Exchange servers within 24 hours.\n- Use Case: Reduces the risk of exploitation by rapidly addressing critical vulnerabilities.\n\nCentralized Patch Management\n\n- Implementation: Implement a centralized patch management system, such as SCCM or ManageEngine, to automate and track patch deployment across all environments. Generate regular compliance reports to ensure all systems are updated.\n- Use Case: Streamlines patching processes and ensures no critical systems are missed.\n\n*Tools for Implementation*\n\nPatch Management Tools:\n\n- WSUS: Manage and deploy Microsoft updates across the organization.\n- ManageEngine Patch Manager Plus: Automate patch deployment for OS and third-party apps.\n- Ansible: Automate updates across multiple platforms, including Linux and Windows.\n\nVulnerability Scanning Tools:\n\n- OpenVAS: Open-source vulnerability scanning to identify missing patches.", "version": "1.1", "techniques_addressed_data": [{"domain": "enterprise", "id": "T1548", "name": "Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism", "technique_used": true, "subtechniques": [{"technique_used": true, "domain": "enterprise", "id": "002", "name": "Bypass User Account Control", "descr": "Consider updating Windows to the latest version and patch level to utilize the latest protective measures against UAC bypass.(Citation: Github UACMe)", "subtechniques": [], "color": 1}], "descr": "Perform regular software updates to mitigate exploitation risk."}, {"domain": "enterprise", "id": "T1110", "name": "Brute Force", "technique_used": false, "subtechniques": [{"technique_used": true, "domain": "enterprise", "id": "001", "name": "Password Guessing", "descr": "Upgrade management services to the latest supported and compatible version.
