compromised devices and leased Virtual Private Servers (VPS). The compromised devices include end-of-life routers and IoT devices, while VPS space is commercially leased and managed by ORB network administrators. This hybrid ORB network allows adversaries to proxy and obscure malicious traffic, making the source of the traffic more difficult to trace.\n\nThe FLORAHOX ORB network has been leveraged by multiple cyber threat actors, including China-nexus actors like [ZIRCONIUM](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0128). These adversaries conduct espionage campaigns through [FLORAHOX Activity](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0053), relying on the ORB network's ability to funnel traffic through [Tor](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0183) nodes, provisioned VPS servers, and compromised routers to obfuscate malicious traffic.(Citation: ORB Mandiant)", "technique_table_data": [{"domain": "enterprise", "id": "T1583", "name": "Acquire Infrastructure", "technique_used": false, "subtechniques": [{"technique_used": true, "domain": "enterprise", "id": "003", "name": "Virtual Private Server", "descr": "[FLORAHOX Activity](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0053) has used acquired Virtual Private Servers as control systems for the ORB network.(Citation: ORB Mandiant)", "subtechniques": [], "color": 1}]}, {"domain": "enterprise", "id": "T1059", "name": "Command and Scripting Interpreter", "technique_used": true, "subtechniques": [{"technique_used": true, "domain": "enterprise", "id": "004", "name": "Unix Shell", "descr": "[FLORAHOX Activity](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0053) has executed multiple Bash controller scripts to provide command line inputs for FLORAHOX traversal configurations.(Citation: ORB Mandiant)", "subtechniques": [], "color": 1}], "descr": "[FLORAHOX Activity](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0053) has executed PHP and Shell scripts to identify and infect subsequent routers for the ORB network.(Citation: ORB Mandiant)"}, {"domain": "enterprise", "id": "T1584", "name": "Compromise Infrastructure", "technique_used": false, "subtechniques": [{"technique_used": true, "domain": "enterprise", "id": "008", "name": "Network Devices", "descr": "[FLORAHOX Activity](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0053) has compromised network routers and IoT devices for the ORB network.(Citation: ORB Mandiant)", "subtechniques": [], "color": 1}]}, {"technique_used": true, "domain": "enterprise", "id": "T1190", "name": "Exploit Public-Facing Application", "descr": "[FLORAHOX Activity](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0053) has exploited and infected vulnerable routers to recruit additional network devices into the ORB.(Citation: ORB Mandiant)", "subtechniques": [], "color": 1}, {"domain": "enterprise", "id": "T1090", "name": "Proxy", "technique_used": false, "subtechniques": [{"technique_used": true, "domain": "enterprise", "id": "003", "name": "Multi-hop Proxy", "descr": "[FLORAHOX Activity](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0053) has routed traffic through a customized [Tor](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0183) relay network layer.(Citation: ORB Mandiant)", "subtechniques": [], "color": 1}]}], "layers": [{"domain": "enterprise", "name": "Enterprise", "filename": "C0053-enterprise-layer.json", "navigator_link": "https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator/"}], "group_data": [], "software_data": [{"id": "S0183", "name": "Tor", "desc": "[FLORAHOX Activity](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0053) has routed traffic through a customized [Tor](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0183) relay network layer.(Citation: ORB Mandiant)"}], "alias_descriptions": [], "citations": {"current_number": 0, "ORB Mandiant": {"description": "Raggi, Michael.
